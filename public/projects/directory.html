                We have organized a national directory of tiny house villages with the goal of creating a network where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Village administrators can work together to better tackle organizational and operational issues.</li>
                        <li>Established villages will help organizers who are trying to get new projects completed. </li>
                        <li>Village constituents and volunteers can be mobilized for political action around housing policy.</li>
                    </ul>
